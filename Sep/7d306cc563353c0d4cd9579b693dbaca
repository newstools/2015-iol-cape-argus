Cape Town - Nyanga is notorious for being the murder capital of the country, but a new police operation in the area is hoping to change that. In 2013 crime statistics for the 2012/2013 year revealed that 262 murder cases were registered at the Nyanga police station, higher than any other in the country. The area has since retained that title and carjackings, robberies and drug-related crimes still hold the community hostage. The police s Operation Stopper was launched in the area on Tuesday and has already had a number of successes, including arrests. About 228kg of dagga was also confiscated. Nyanga station commander Brigadier Vuyisile Ncata said he was happy about the operation, adding that he believed it would yield great success and would mend the image of the force . The operation will help a lot. It will bring back the community s trust in the police and we will be available and visible. They are scared because it is like the criminals are the ones in charge. Ncata said some of the trends they noted were that most of the crimes committed in the area were by people under the influence of drugs. Cluster commander Brigadier Phumzile Cetyana said they would monitor the trends and move the operation around accordingly. With crime, once you focus on one area, the crime moves to another area. National police commissioner General Riah Phiyega said policing in the area was receiving a much-needed boost through the operation. The objective is rolling out a lockdown and to reduce crime in the area. I know it is known for carjackings and murders, but this operation will try to suppress that. Operation Stopper will continue in the area for sometime until the situation is stabilised. We appeal to the community to continue working with us. Fighting crime is not negotiable, we will use our resources as little as they are to ensure we reduce levels of crime, said Phiyega. [email&#160;protected]Cape Argus
