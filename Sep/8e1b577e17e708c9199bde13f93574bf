Plettenberg Bay - The Plettenberg Bay man with alleged links to an international child pornography network which distributes images and footage of babies as young as only a few days old being raped and abused is expected to go on trial in the Knysna Regional Court.The 37-year-old computer engineer, who cannot be named until he has pleaded, appeared briefly in court on Wednesday.The man was arrested at his seaside home on January 13 after a lengthy investigation by local and Belgian police.The bust was part of a police operation, by both countries specialised sexual crimes units, called Cloud 9 and involved cracking open a child-pornography ring linked to a cyber-meeting space for paedophiles whose fetishes seem to be the sexual abuse of babies.The local suspect was identified after members of the Antwerp police child and sexual exploitation unit used the profile of a Belgium suspect who was arrested in October last year to track him down.Police managed to find sections of files allegedly containing hundreds of images and videos of violent assaults as well as internet addresses of more than 300 alleged paedophiles.The Plettenberg man took his place in the dock on Wednesday, but the matter was postponed to October 19 after the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) made a decision that the matter should be heard in the regional court and not the high court.His legal representative, Carl Jeppe, said he was ready to start negations with the State on behalf of his client. Bail was extended.Meanwhile, the Plettenberg Bay man s arrest has also led to eight other South Africans being arrested across the country about half of the suspects from the eastern and southern Cape.The latest suspect was apprehended on Tuesday.Women and Men Against Child Abuse spokesman Germaine Vogel said the other suspects had been identified after allegedly sharing the same child abuse images and footage that had allegedly been found in the Plettenberg Bay man s possession.On Tuesday, police arrested a 22-year-old KwaZulu-Natal man and confiscated a laptop allegedly containing thousands of child abuse images and videos.This came after another four suspects, including a 47-year-old Cape Town broker and three others two men and a woman from Hercules in Pretoria, were arrested a week earlier. When the suspects were arrested, police also confiscated six cellphones, four desktop computers, a laptop and three USB drives.The other suspects are a 53-year-old Grahamstown businessman who was arrested on March 11, a Port Elizabeth couple apprehended on March 17 and a 39-year-old Midrand man arrested on March 19. We applaud (the police) for their ongoing investigation of child pornography rings here and abroad and for their dedication and commitment in securing several arrests this year, Vogel said. Despite all the arrests made this year these users of graphic material depicting the rape of small children have not been deterred from continuing their illegal activities.
