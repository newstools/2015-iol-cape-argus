Cape Town - Upgrades to Gouda train station have been completed and a R4 million overhaul of the unsafe railway line is expected to begin in January. The Passenger Rail Agency of SA (Prasa) said an improvement directive was issued in 2013 after they received a complaint about conditions at the station which posed a danger to commuters.This week the Cape Argus reported that the Railway Safety Regulator of SA decided to shut down the railway station for safety reasons. Some of the reasons listed included holes in the platforms, which were also said to be dangerously low in relation to the train tracks, the absence of toilet facilities and insufficient lighting in the evenings. The safety regulator also discovered that the train lengths exceeded the platform length which meant that at least five carriages could not stop along the platform. In addressing the complaint, Prasa said upgrades to station lighting, signage and shelter on the platform started and were completed in March last year at a cost of R700 000. Prasa confirms that since 2013 there has been no safety-related incidents regarding customers boarding and getting off at Gouda station. Given the nature and extent of the work to be done on the rebuilding of the platform, more funding is required as work forms part of capital funding for which a tendering process is required, the statement read. Metrorail s regional manager, Richard Walker, said Metrorail has introduced a bus service between Tulbagh, Gouda and Wellington for commuters travelling to and from Gouda station.Cape Argus
