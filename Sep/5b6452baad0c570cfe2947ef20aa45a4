Cape Town - The principal of South Peninsula High School has accused the Western Cape Education Department of continuing to victimise him and his school after a staff member was charged with misconduct while a disciplinary hearing against the principal is under way.Earlier this year the Cape Argus reported that Brian Isaacs was facing six charges of misconduct, which includes an alleged assaulted on a pupil as well as victimisation and improper conduct against learners .He has denied all allegations against him and accused the department of a witch-hunt.Last week, Isaacs said the department had now charged a staff member with misconduct.This charge relates to the alleged assault of a pupil during the first term by kicking him against his foot and/or ankle .The department has denied that it was victimising anyone at the school.But Isaacs said the staff member in question was a key witness in his own case and was yet to testify.And he questioned why the charge against the staff member was only brought now while the alleged assault took place in the first term.He said an official had brought the notice of the staff member s disciplinary hearing on September 2 but the pre-hearing meeting had been scheduled for August 26.Isaacs also questioned why the department was continuing with the disciplinary hearing against him when criminal charges had been withdrawn. They (the department) are trying to intimidate me. Millicent Merton, a spokeswoman for the department, confirmed that the staff member had been charged with misconduct.Asked why the charge was brought now when the alleged assault took place in the first term, Merton said: Due to the number of misconduct cases - excluding grievances, disputes, training at schools and other administrative functions - priority is given to cases involving sexual misconduct and complex forensic investigative cases. She said there had been a typing error in the notice of the staff member s disciplinary hearing. No one is being victimised. The Western Cape Education Department s directorate: employee relations, must comply with processes in terms of the Employment of Educators Act, relevant circulars and prescripts. Many employees are charged on a regular basis for misconduct throughout the province. Merton said the criminal case and the disciplinary matter were independent processes. That means that the WCED is not dependent on the outcome of the criminal matter and the burdens of proof are not the same. [email&#160;protected]Cape Argus
